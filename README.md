This is a simple to-do list app prototype which I built to understand how organizational applications work and to 
implement one myself since such applications can be very beneficial for students' time management. Users can input their task and 
ultimately cross it off like a checklist once done, to keep track of all their remaining tasks. This project allowed me to learn more 
about JavaScript.
